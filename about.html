            <p>I started gaming when I was a wide-eyed kid, my fingers dancing across the keyboard as
                I explored pixelated realms. Back then, it was all about the thrill of collecting coins,
                defeating bosses, and saving princesses. Little did I know that this playful pastime
                would evolve into a lifelong passion, shaping my creativity, strategic thinking, and even
                my friendships. From retro classics to cutting-edge titles, gaming has been my steadfast
                companion, providing solace during tough times and exhilaration during triumphs.</p>

        <h2>My Gaming Setup</h2>
        <div class="container">
            <p>I enjoy gaming on my MSI Katana GF66 laptop, which features an RTX 3050 graphics card.
                For precise control, I use a white DareU mouse, and my audio experience is enhanced by
                HyperX in-ear headphones. When it comes to typing, I rely on the tactile feedback of
                my brown switch mechanical keyboard from Corsair.</p>
